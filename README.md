A simple calculator with basic arthemetic operation
Here's a description of the provided code for a simple calculator:

1. The code defines four functions for basic arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Each function takes two numbers as input and returns the result of the corresponding operation.

2. The main function serves as the entry point of the program. It displays a menu of available operations to the user.

3. The user is prompted to input two numbers and choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).

4. The program then calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice and displays the result of the calculation.

5. Input validation for the operation choice is performed to ensure that the user provides a valid choice.

6. The program terminates after displaying the result, allowing the user to perform another calculation or exit the program.

Overall, this code provides a simple and interactive calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.
